Origin
========

Origin is a visual piece that I made for representing activity on a micro level that saturates after a point.

This version has been build on vc110. To build on other platforms - 
* Clean
* Then build as usual

* Create new project using OpenFrameworks projectgenerator
* Copy all files under /src to new location under the OSX project directory src.
* Add the new files to make from XCode.
